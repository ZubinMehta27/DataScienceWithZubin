# 🚀 DataScienceWithZubin

Welcome to my Data Science journey! This repository is a growing collection of self-learned projects focused on Python, data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

As someone coming from a non-technical background, I’m learning everything from scratch through hands-on practice — and sharing each step publicly to stay accountable, improve, and grow.
